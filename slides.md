::left:: 

Would I do it again?
> Yes. The offloading and reliability of the system are indispensible, yet I would try and avoid some mistakes throughout the process.

Can I start small?
> Yes. The ATEM Mini Pro is the smallest devices. Yet, you will need at least a camera with an HDMI output and a microphone with an audio jack. Do your research, though! Know what you can and can't do with the setup or you will be unhappy and either throw it all out or buy more and more devices.


What about price?
> Prepare to invest in the thousands of USD or EUR. Yes, it will be cheaper to start with Software, BUT: Ecamm Live costs > USD 300 per year and with more than one 1080p video source, you will be smoking your CPU, soon. If you buy a dedicated gaming workstation, you will be in the thousands, too.

::right::

Which mistakes did you make?
> I bought most devices multiple times. Starting with the ATEM Mini Pro, I soon realized 4 HDMI inputs is not going to be enough. Now, I have the ATEM Mini Extreme but I should have gone for the Extreme ISO model right away. Similarly, I started with a different microphone and audio interface.

Anything I need to know?
> All your USB devices are useless, now. Try to sell them.
